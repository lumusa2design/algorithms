## How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Create a new branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b improve-algorithm-x


Make your changes. Please ensure:
- Your code is clean and well-indented.
- You use clear and descriptive variable/function names.
- You follow the structure and conventions used in the project.

3. **Commit your changes with a meaningful message:**

    git commit -m "Improved X algorithm for better performance"

    Push your branch and open a Pull Request to the main branch of the original repository.

Code Style

Use descriptive names for variables and functions.

Add comments if the algorithm is complex or non-obvious.

Prioritize readability over cleverness.

In Python, follow PEP 8.

Adding a New Algorithm

When adding a new algorithm:

 -   Place it in the appropriate folder (e.g., sort/, graph/, search/, etc.).

-  Name the file clearly, such as quick_sort.py.

-    Include a short description at the top of the file.

 -   Add example usage or simple test cases if possible.

Issues and Suggestions

  If you find a bug or have an improvement idea, feel free to open an Issue describing the problem or feature.

   Please be clear and concise when explaining.

Thank You

Your contributions help make this project better for everyone. ðŸ™Œ
