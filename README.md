# 📔Algorithms📔

A short personal project where I will be developing different algorithms from the most basic to the most complicated ones.


## 💻 Type of algorithms

### Sortings algorithms
sorting algorithms
These are algorithms that take unordered lists and after a series of iterations, return a sorted list.
At the moment we have developed the following algorithms:
- Bogosort
- Bubblesort
- Countingsort
- Insertionsort
- Selectionsort
- Stalinsort

#### Algorithms to implement:

- Radixsort
- Heapsort
- Bucketsort
- 

### Data structures

### Search algorithms

### Predictive algorithms

### Probabilistic algorithms


### Genetic algorithms
