## What is a Data Structure?

In computer science, a **data structure** is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving, and storing data efficiently.  
They are the building blocks of efficient algorithms, since the choice of the right structure can significantly improve performance in terms of **time** and **memory usage**.

## 📚 Categories of Data Structures

Data structures can be broadly classified into two categories:


- **Linear Data Structures**
    
    Data is  arranged in a sequential manner.
    
  *examples*: `Arrays` , `Linked Lists`, `Stacks`, `Queues`
- **Non-Linear Data Structures**

    Data is not stored sequentially, but hierarchically or with complex relationships.

    *Examples*: `Trees`, `Graphs`, `Hash Tables`

## 💡 Why are Data Structures Important?

- Optimize **searching**
- Enable efficient **memory management**
- Provide reusable components for solving complex problems
